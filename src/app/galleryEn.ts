    name:"White Mahakala",
    description:"White Mahakala is rare form of the wrathful Buddhist deity. He is associated with the attainment of wealth. The following description is according to his sadhana: His body is white. His face is wrathful and he has three eyes. He has six arms. His main right hand holds a wish- fulfilling jewel mounted on a jewel-tipped handle, in front of his chest. This emblem is held by deities associated particularly with wealth. The White Mahakala is more unusual than the customary black form. He is especially popular in Mongolia as the main protector deity of Mongolia., given such distinction by the third Dalai Lama. The teachings of the White Mahakala were brought to Tibet in the eleventh century by Khedrup Khyungpopa, who also brought the teachings of the Six-armed Black Mahakala. Performing the White Mahakala ritual is supposed to bring endless wealth to the needy practitioner in such things as family, material goods, food, power, knowledge, and spirituality."

    name:"Begtse",
    description:"Begtse has red skin and orange-red hair, two arms (as opposed to other Mahākālas, who have four or six), three blood-shot eyes and is wielding a sword in his right hand. He also holds a human heart in his right hand. In the stock of his right arm, he holds a bow and arrow and a halberd with bannet. He wears a chainmail shirt, which gave rise to his name, Jamsaran. He wears a Mongolian helmet with a crown of five skulls and four banners in the back. He is also accompanied by his consort, Rikpay Lhamo, and his main general, Laihansorgodog. They are surrounded by Jamsaran's satellites, the twenty-nine butchers. The name Begtse (Wylie: Beg tse) is a loanword from Mongolian begder, meaning 'coat of mail'.

    name:"Yamantaka",
    description:"Yamantaka. Manjushri, the bodhisattva of wisdom, assumed the ferocious form of Yamantaka to conquer death. Death is visualized as a ferocious bull in Tibetan mythology, and is known as Yama, who is also the Hindu god of death. The tale behind Yamantaka's origin states that to tame Yama, Manjushri adopted the same form of a bull, adding to it eight other faces and a multiple array of arms, each holding fearful and deadly weapons. He further sprouted a number of legs, and surrounded himself with a vast host of terrifying beings. To confront death, he thus manifested the form of death itself, magnified to infinity. Death (Yama) saw himself endlessly mirrored back to himself, infinitely outnumbered by himself. Death was literally scared to death. Thus the yogi who meditates through the imagery of Yamantaka intends and hopes to develop a sense of identity strong enough to face down death, and the fear that attends upon it. Each head, each limb, each attribute, symbol and ornament of Yamantaka expresses the total mobilization of the faculties of enlightenment needed for this ultimate confrontation."

    name:"Jambhala",
    description:"Jambhala (Kubera) is a wealth deity whose blessings remove the obstacle of poverty, bringing wealth and abundance to pure Dharma practitioners. As it is difficult to attain spiritual realizations while afflicted by a lack of resources, Jambhala generates prosperity so that practitioners have the time, energy, and means to accomplish it. According to the Sutras, while Shakyamuni Buddha was teaching one day, demons tried to disturb and confuse the Buddha. Jambhala appeared in front of the Buddha and protected him. Recognizing Jambhala's courageous action, the Buddha asked Jambhala if he would like to become a Dharma Protector in order to help all sentient beings. Jambhala accepted the Buddha's offer, and since then he has offered immediate assistance to all who call his name or chant his mantra. His blessings bestow good luck, increase virtues, prolong life, increase intelligence, and provide both material and spiritual benefits."

    name:"Vajrapani",
    description:"Vajrapani is regarded as the personification of power and the guardian of the tantric teachings of the Buddha. In time out of mind he was assigned the task of vanquishing a demon known as Nagpo Tsalak and was blessed with a name that literally means “Conqueror of the Four Quarters.” At that time he also swore to uphold the teachings of the thousand buddhas for this entire eon. He is said to have many pure lands, accessible to the few who know the paths by which to enter them. The realm where he is personally said to dwell is called Chang Lo Chen in Tibetan, or Adákavati in Sanskrit. His dark blue hue indicates that he never ceases to be absorbed in the blissful Truth Body or Dharmakaya. Although he appears as a wrathful deity, in fact his wrath is merely to protect the dharma from those who would destroy it. The vajra he holds in his right hand represents the knowledge that is the essence of the teachings of the Buddha. He is often depicted in a triad with Avalokiteshvara and Manjushri known as Rigsum Gonpo, symbolizing the qualities necessary for enlightenment – compassion, wisdom and power."

    description:"Green Tara or Shyama-Tara, also known as Green Liberating Mother, is a female, peaceful Buddha and Bodhisattva in Tibetan Buddhism. Green Tara is the primary form within the mandala of the 21 Taras, each expressing different facets of her Buddha activity. Although Green Tara appears relatively late in the Vajrayana Buddhist literature (first Tibetan translation in the 12th century), she originated from an Indian star goddess and was also worshipped in Indian Mahayana from the 3rd century. In Tibetan Buddhism, Green Tara is now revered like few other Bodhisattvas. The praise of the 21 Taras is one of the most common Sadhanas."

His name in Sanskrit means “gentle, or sweet, glory”; he is also known as Mãnjughoṣa (“Sweet Voice”) and Vāgīśvara (“Lord of Speech”). In China he is called Wen-shu Shih-li, in Japan Monju, and in Tibet ’Jam-dpal. Although sutras (Buddhist scriptures) were composed in his honour by at least AD 250, he does not seem to have been represented in Buddhist art before AD 400. He is most commonly shown wearing princely ornaments, his right hand holding aloft the sword of wisdom to cleave the clouds of ignorance and his left holding a palm-leaf manuscript of the Prajñāpāramitā. He is sometimes depicted seated on a lion or on a blue lotus; and in paintings his skin is usually yellow in colour."

    name:"Amitayus",
    description:"Amitayus, also known as the Buddha of Limitless Life, is a Buddha aspect or deity associated with meditations and mantras for a long life. In Mahayana and Vajrayana, Amitayus is considered another form of Buddha Amitabha. The major Mahayana sutras that describe Amitayus are the Smaller and Greater Sukhavativyuha Sutras, where he teaches beings in the Pure Land of Amitabha, and the Amitayurdhyana Sutra. Often, both names are used interchangeably. The specific sutra on Buddha Amitayus is the Arya Aparamita Ayurgyena Nama Mahayana Sutra, or the Great Vehicle Sutra of Profound Mysterious Life and Transcendental Wisdom, although it is more like a hymn that proclaims the merits and virtues of Amitayus and gives us the long mantra of Amitayus. Amitayus is usually depicted in a meditative posture with a vase (kalasha) in his hands, containing the elixir of immortality (amrita) and leaves of the Ashoka tree. It symbolizes 'a long life without the misery (shoka) of sickness'. On top of the vase, there may be an alms bowl. When we talk about Amitayus, 'Limitless Life' refers to his blessings and virtues, while 'Limitless Light' refers to his wisdom as Amitabha. The blessings, virtues, and wisdom of Amitayus are limitless, as are his spiritual powers, attributes, and teachings."

Saraswati is the Divine Embodiment & bestower of Enlightened Eloquence & Inspiration, patroness of the arts, sciences, music, language, literature, history, poetry & philosophy, all those engaged in creative endeavours in Tibetan Buddhism. She is considered the peaceful manifestation of Palden Lhamo (Glorious Goddess). In the Gelugpa tradition, Palden Lhamo is known as Magzor Gyalmo (the Queen who Repels Armies) and is a wrathful emanation of Saraswati while being a protector. Saraswati was the yidam (principal personal meditational deity) of 14th century Tibetan monk Je Tsongkhapa. He composed a devotional poem to her. She is believed in the Tibetan tradition to have accompanied him on his travels, as well as regularly engaging in conversations with him."
